A reftagger for all the Quranic and Biblical references you may have.  If you have
a reference to "An-Nas 1-2" it would automatically insert a tooltip for that ayah
so you don't need to link to it manually, and you don't need to google it separately.
Everything is done inline so you can continue reading.  This also works for Arabic
sites that have Arabic Quranic / Biblical references.

## Installation

[COMING SOON]

## Tooltips

This library uses tippy.js to display its tooltips.  If you already use tippy.js
this could cause some conflict.  Please let us know if this is an issue for you.
